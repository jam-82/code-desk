//setInterval()

calls a function or evaluate an expression at specified intervals, it will continue calling the function until the interval is cleared or the window is closed

keep calling the function until we tell to stop or we close the window down

//clearInterval()
will stop the time running

assign the setInterval to a variable timerId
we can then use this Id , putting the timerId into clearInterval(---)  
That will stop the interval from running

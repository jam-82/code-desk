includes method can be an array and string method, it can determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false.

=======================================


Deprecated: substr() is no longer recommended, is advised to uses substring() method and the slice() method,  to make the code maximally cross-platform friendly.


The substr() method returns a portion of the string, starting at the specified index and extending for a given number of characters afterwards.

*The substring() method returns the part of the string from the start index up to and excluding the end index, or the end of the string if no end index is supplied.


difference substr and substring:

const text = "Mozilla";
console.log(text.substring(2,5)); //"zil"
console.log(text.substr(2,3)); //"zil"


========================================


The charAt() method returns a new string located at the specified offset into the string.

const sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.';

console.log(sentence.charAt(4))// "q"
console.log(sentence.charAt(10))// "b"

The charAt() method use by default 0 if the index is omitted.
If the index we use is out of the range of the string length, the method returns a empty string ""


=========================================


const sentence ="The quick brown fox"

console.log(sentence.toUpperCase())//"THE QUICK BROWN FOX"

addEventListener()




















events:

mouseover is fired at an Element when a pointing device(mouse or pad) is used to move the cursor onto the element or one of its child elements.

=======================


if the script is in the <head>
the html is no loaded before the javascript, and the javascript don't work

In this case we need to make sure the html is  loaded before

so in my javascript file i need to write all my code inside this:

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',() => {

})

binary search

run time for algoritms
simple search: linear time   O(n) (one by one),
simple search runs at what is known as O(n)

binary search: log time    O(log n) 
is a halving algoritm,
is faster than simple search when the list is bigger and bigger,
binary search runs at what is known as O(log n)

algoritms are written in big 0 Notation

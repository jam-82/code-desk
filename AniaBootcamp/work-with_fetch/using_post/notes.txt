//POST requests

//able to post data to an api

I can send data to my api, in order to add a new burger object

const data = { username: 'example' }

fetch('https://xxx', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type: 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
    console.log('Success:', data)
})
.catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error', error)
})


//This time we pass 2 arguments into fetch: the url and also an object 
// with the method of 'POST' we are telling our fetch api we are posting this data to the url (i don't wanna GET it)
and we are passing an object which has the method of 'POST' , the header and the body
the body is what we tell it to be in the const data variable

.then we are catching the response and the data with 'success' message.

or if it has been an error, we can catch the error and we're able to see that in our console log

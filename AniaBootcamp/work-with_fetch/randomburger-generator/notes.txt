//FETCH
provide a javascript interface for accessing and manipulating part of the http pipeline, such as request and response

//we are gonna be using a burger api in  order to randomly generate burger name if we click the button

we're gonna have a GET request to get all the burgers
and we can do this with fetch()
//syntaxe:
fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))

//only once we have the data we can use what we have

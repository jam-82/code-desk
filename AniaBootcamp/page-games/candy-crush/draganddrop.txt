A typical drag operation begins when a user selects a draggable element, continues when the user drags the element to a droppable element, and then ends when the user releases the dragged element.
During the operations, several event types are fired, and some events might fire many times
Making an element draggable requires adding the draggable attribute and the dragstart event handler.

<script>
  function dragstartHandler(ev) {
    // Add the target element's id to the data transfer object
    ev.dataTransfer.setData("text/plain", ev.target.id);
  }

  window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    // Get the element by id
    const element = document.getElementById("p1");
    // Add the ondragstart event listener
    element.addEventListener("dragstart", dragstartHandler);
  });
</script>

<p id="p1" draggable="true">This element is draggable.</p>


drag event type:
drag
dragstart
dragover fires when a dragged item is being dragged over a valid drop target, every few hundred milliseconds
dragleave fires when a dragged item leaves a    valid drop target.
dragenter fires when a dragged item enters a valid drop target.
dragend
drop

e.preventDefault() to prevent additional event processing for this event(such as touch events or pointer events)

advanced:
At the end of a drag operation , the dragend event fires at the source element the element that was the target of the drag start.
The drageend event handler can check the value of the dropEffect property to determine if the drag operation succeeded or not.
